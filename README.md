# Python-mini_apps

(Will eventually be) a collection of small functional programmes made in Python.

Programmes included:
1. PDF_translator - takes a pdf in a language other than English, translates it to English and saves the result as a new pdf.
2. File_keyword_Search - searches through PDF and Word files in a specified folder and returns those which contain a keyword/key phrase chosen by the user. These files can then be opened externally or saved as shortcuts in a subfolder.
